 I designed a comprehensive dashboard to track and analyze key sales metrics, including revenue, profit margins, and customer demographics. The dashboard features dynamic charts and pivot tables that allow for real-time filtering by region, product, and time period. It improved data retrieval time by 40% and helped the sales team quickly identify performance trends, top-selling products, and areas for growth, ultimately supporting better decision-making and strategic planning.
